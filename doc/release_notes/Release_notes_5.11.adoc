== Fixed incorrect response for Get Account Details request for consents with ownerName

From now on, the endpoint `GET /v1/accounts/{resource-id}` will return `ownerName` in the response, if a consent
with a correct `ownerName` property in its `additionalInformation` has been created and successfully authorised
beforehand.
