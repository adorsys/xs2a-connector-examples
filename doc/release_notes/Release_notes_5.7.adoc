= Release notes v. 5.7

== Table of Contents

* Update Account Owner Name Service
* Store and export data from CMS for PSU related headers

== Update Account Owner Name Service

From now on, Account Owner Name Service has several changes:

* In Consent request body "additionalAccountInformation" field was renamed to "additionalInformation";
* In Consent request body fields "availableAccounts", "availableAccountsWithBalance" and "allPsd2" may have additional value "allAccountsWithOwnerName";
* Field "ownerAddress" was removed from Consent request body and Account Details;

Also if TPP creates consent with additional information and the ASPSP doesn't support it (accountOwnerInformationSupported=false) then TPP will receive HTTP 401 response code with message code "CONSENT_INVALID" and text message "An explicit consent of ownerName is not supported."

== Store and export data from CMS for PSU related headers

From now on, xs2a supports a new table `additional_psu_data` which saves additional, psu-related, fields, such as `psu-ip-port`, `psu-user-agent`, `psu-geo-location`, `psu-accept`,
`psu-accept-charset`, `psu-accept-encoding`, `psu-accept-language`, `psu-http-method` and `psu-device-id`.
These fields are provided through initiating endpoints for AIS or PIS. Also, `psu-ip-address` is now persisted as well, and saved inside of the `psu_data` table.
