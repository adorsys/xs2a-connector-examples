== Support integrated and pre-step OAuth based on custom header

From now on, connector is capable of switching between Redirect, integrated OAuth and pre-step OAuth approaches based on custom OAuth header(`X-OAUTH-PREFERRED`).
Supported values are `pre-step` and `integrated`.
In order for OAuth modes to work correctly, `OAUTH` SCA approach has to be marked as supported in ASPSP profile.
